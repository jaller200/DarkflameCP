# Darkflame CP

DarkflameCP is a PHP server source based on Kitsune and modified to maintain efficiency, readability, and better functionality.

__NOTE: This code is in development! Source may be buggy or refuse to work at all! Proceed at your own risk__

#### Setup

To run DarkflameCP, simply input the following:

> `php DarkflameCP.php`

This will start whatever servers are defined in the PHP file itself.

Future plans are in place to move server settings to an external XML file to allow for custom servers to be quickly setup.
